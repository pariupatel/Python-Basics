"""

para is a sequence of space-separated words. All words will be in lower case. There will be a single space between consecutive words. The string has no other special characters other than the space.

Write a function named exact_count that accepts the string para and a positive integer n as arguments. You have to return True if there is at least one word in para that occurs exactly n times, and False otherwise. 

You do no thave to accept input from the user or print output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.

#true if at least one word occurs only than once.
#false if no word occurs for exactly once.
